# ML-Models

We are going to use medicinal leaf image dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bijlyborkatullah/medicinal-plant-bijly-withbg/data) from Kaggle to illustrate the data processing and model implementation here using TF/Keras.

We are going to develop two(2) different kind of models using tensorflow and keras for the medicinal leaf recognition. These models commonly use keras image pre-processing utility for image dataset reshaping and pre-processing.

The first(1st) model is a simple CNN/DNN model and offers flexibility to play around optimizing the layers and weights to improve the training and validation accuracy while miniming their losses respectively.

The second(2nd) model is based on Transfer Learning where we are going to use InceptionV3 pre-trained model as the base and build custom DNN layers on top of it to quickly arrive at an optimized training/validation metrics.

Both of these models can be downloaded and optimized further with additional data (or) you can try using it with a new image dataset from a different use case as well.

Pls continue to enjoy your learning experience with TF/Keras to train a machine.
