ML Models for different use cases

We are going to use medicinal image dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bijlyborkatullah/medicinal-plant-bijly-withbg/data) to illustrate the data processing and model preparation. Also, we are going to use here a pre-trained inception(InceptionV3) model with custom layers on top of it for analysis & prediction of the medicinal plants data.

The advantage with this dataset as we see is the data is organized into training, validation and testing sub-folders but however the disadvantages are 
1. Small volume of data for each of the classification under each of the sub-folders
2. Datasets are restricted to be collected from a country
